The red bar is armor. When armor is gone, the ship will explode. An energy shield is not as hard as armor, but it can regenerate over time.
Use these modules to upgrade the starbase:</string>

    <string name="TutorialMessage3">The starbase can be very helpful in battle, as it can also attack the enemies. Try to install these cannons.</string>
